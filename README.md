# Date-Time-Clock-and-Humidity-Project-Code-for-the-Arduino
This one here is a date/time temperature and humidity device using the LCD Screen on a Arduino Microcontroller,
No RTC - Real Time Clock was used in the system, so once arduino resets it loses it's date and time ;(

Also, there is a well known bug as shown in the Video:

Since this is a really old project of mine, i won't bother fixing anything broken here.
